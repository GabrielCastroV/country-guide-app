# Country Guide

Country Guide is a simple web application that allows users to search for countries by name, displaying relevant information about the countries found. It provides details such as the country's name, capital, population, region, temperature (in degrees Celsius), and current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, overcast, rainy, etc.).
